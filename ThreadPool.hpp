 * @brief ThreadPool
 *  this thread pool manage many threads with scalability, impl with  impl idiom.
 *    Our goal is to  not to burden the system and can run tasks effiently.
 *    (1)when the thread is in idle status, user can delete it.
 *    (2)we manage the number of threads between @minCap and @maxCap
 *    (3) if the thread pool is full,  the tasks will just be filled in a queue and waiting for the thread.
 *  TODO:
 *  consider  impl:
 *     1)a  naive master/slave ThreadPool  :  NaiveThreadPoolImpl
 *     2)a Leader/Follower ThreadPool      :  LFThreadPoolImpl
 *     3)a Half Sync/Half Async ThreadPool :  HSHAThreadPoolImpl
